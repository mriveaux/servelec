Check & Log email allows you to test if your WordPress installation is sending emails correctly by sending a test email to an address of your choice. Allows overriding of email headers and carbon copying to another address.

== Description ==

In need of a tool that allows you to easily log and view all emails sent from WordPress? Check & Log might be just the solution for that. 
This WordPress plugin helps you store sent emails for auditing purposes, as well as debug email related problems in your WordPress site. Works best on eCommerce websites that have been created with WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads.

Some of its features include:

Check email - if youâ€™re not sure whether WordPress is sending emails, you can use Check & Log to find out. The process is very simple: you need to choose an address that will receive a simple test email. You can even override the custom header with your own values, to avoid any other issues.

Viewing logged emails - they can be viewed from the admin interface, as they are stored in a separate table. You get the option to filter them based on subject, email, date, etc.

Deleting logged emails - you can delete them by going to the admin interface. You can either delete them in bulk or  selectively - by date, email, or subject. 

== Installation ==

Install the plugin from the plugin repository and activate.
